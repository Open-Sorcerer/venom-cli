# âœ¨ Our Features

### Create Wallet

With the `create` option, you can easily create a new Venom blockchain wallet. This command generates a new wallet address and private key, allowing you to securely store and manage your digital assets. Creating a wallet is the first step towards engaging with the Venom blockchain ecosystem.

### Create Frontend Boilerplate

The `create-frontend` option enables you to set up a NextJS frontend boilerplate template specifically designed for Venom blockchain projects. This template includes all the necessary configurations and dependencies to get you started quickly.&#x20;

### Track Addresses and Transactions

Stay up to date with the transactions occurring on specific addresses using the `track` option. This feature enables you to monitor addresses and transactions based on Devnet or on a Custom RPC.&#x20;

### Error Handling

Our CLI tool includes robust error-handling mechanisms to ensure a smooth experience. If you enter an invalid operation, the tool will display an informative error message and guide you towards the available options. We strive to provide a user-friendly environment that allows you to focus on your development tasks without unnecessary distractions.
