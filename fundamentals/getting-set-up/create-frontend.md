# ðŸ”§ Create Frontend

The `create-frontend` function in our CLI tool provides a streamlined way to set up a frontend for your Venom blockchain projects.

To create a frontend for your Venom blockchain project, follow the steps below:

1. Run the CLI tool and run the command&#x20;

```
venom-advanced-cli create-frontend 
```

2. You will be prompted to choose the framework you want to use for your frontend. Currently, the supported options are "NextJS" and "ReactJS". Use the arrow keys to navigate the options and press Enter to make your selection.
3. After selecting the framework, you will be prompted to enter a project name for your frontend. This name will be used as the directory name for your frontend project.
4. Sit back and let the CLI tool handle the setup process. You will see the progress and output of the commands in the terminal.

Once the frontend setup is complete, you will have a ready-to-use frontend project directory based on your chosen framework.
